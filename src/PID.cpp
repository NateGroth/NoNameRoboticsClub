/*
This is a class that creates a PID output. It is initialized with two tuning values. This should contain a function that takes in a signed float and returns a signed float. 
* Initializes with tuning values for gain and damping
* Internally will implement PID control
* Needs to be reusable anywhere a PID controller is needed
* (Optional) take in a direct PPM or PWM input (for servos) and generate a PPM/PWM output.
