/*
This is a class that initializes with parameters for the used PPM input pins (from flysky IS-A6 RX). This needs to convert the PPM signals to an integer or signed float value to be used in the rest of the program. Should include a function that returns an array[6] of these float/int values.
* Reads from 6 PPM pins
* Initializes with definition of pins
* Contains function to return normalized values
