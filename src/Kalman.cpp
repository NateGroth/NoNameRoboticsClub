/*
	This is a class that takes in gyro, accelerometer, and barometer readings and returns filtered values. Initializes with initial values for all sensors (for prediction to converge). Contains a function that reads in gyro/accelerometer or barometer readings and returns their filtered values.
* Use a Kaman algorithm for each dataset
* Build a separate function/initializer for each type of data input
